# 📚 StudyTracker

This is a small Blazor WebAssembly project I built to practice C# and frontend development using Blazor.  
The idea was to build a simple study tracking app where I can track how much I study every day and see my consistency over time.

The whole app runs in the browser and does not use any backend.

## What I did in this project

- Built a dashboard to add multiple study tasks with target hours  
- Implemented start and stop study sessions using a timer  
- Calculated live progress for each task and overall daily progress  
- Saved study data in the browser using LocalStorage  
- Stored daily progress automatically  
- Created a calendar view to visualize daily consistency  

## What you can see when you run the app

### Study Dashboard
- Add study goals like C# Practice or ML Revision  
- Start a study session and see the time update live  
- Stop or switch tasks and keep the progress saved  
- Progress bars update in real time  
- Overall daily progress across all tasks  

### Calendar View
- Monthly calendar showing study consistency  
- Each day is color coded based on how much of the daily goal was completed  
- Completed days are easy to identify visually
